# Testing-my-Comcast-Connection
This mini-project is designed to help me diagnose why my internet connection intermittently slows down. It includes a bash script repeatedly pings my personal router, google.com, facebook.com, and other popular websites using IP packets of various sizes, and stores the results in a MySQL database.
